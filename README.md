## Welcome to my Github profile!

### About me

I am a CS/CE student at the University of Ioannina, Greece. Games, D&D, music and Anime are my passions.

#### Software development

Solving puzzles, finding solutions to problems and automating stuff are all activities that excite me, so I tried my hands on programming.
Since I discovered C/C++ back in High school, I haven't tried different programming languages and I have taken part in various programming events, 
like IEEE Xtreme, Hashcode and seasonal contests on CodinGames.

#### 3D Modelling and Animation

Creating stuff is another of my passions and since I am a computer freak, 3D modelling is a perfect match for me. For the past few years, I have watched 
plenty tutorials on Blender and have created many renders and animations.

#### Game development

Game development combines my love for problem solving and creativity, so it was the natural next step. I have created a few small games, both 2D and 3D.
